                        Hey, I'm Pujan, a problem-solver with a passion for crafting intuitive digital experiences. 
                        My love for design and development drives me to blend functionality with creativity. 
                        When I’m not bringing ideas to life online, you can find me hiking, 
                        cooking up new recipes, or diving into the world of photography.

                            As it was new back then the snapdragon 730 chipset has left a lasting impression on me. 
                            It has been a great phone with good hardware and software support till 2022.</br></br>
                            After 5 years of usage, the phone has impressed me in various ways. 
                            But after 2 years of no software updates and the deteriorating hardware, 
                            it is showing problems and is a little sluggish at times. 
                            But for sticking 5 years with me, this has been a great smartphone to use till date.

                            Which is running windows 11 and can play various computer games which are available in steam and other 3rd party game stores. 
                            Having Windows OS also gives the ROG Ally an added edge over other portable gaming devices.</br></br>
                            The Rog Ally is a competetion to the steamdeck which is also a portable gaming console running the SteamOS and could also run windows 11. As for comparing,
                            the Rog Ally was more reasonable price for the quality of this product, and could compete with some computers and laptops.
